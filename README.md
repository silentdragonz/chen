Pomf replacement written in Elixir on the Phoenix Framework. This was written purely for fun and to experiment a little with Elixir.

1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Install js dependencies with `bower install`
3. Install brunch.io with `npm install`
4. Copy font files from UIKit to `/priv/static/fonts`
5. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser.

# Configuration

Override the default config options with files `dev.secret.exs` and `prod.secret.exs`
